# UFO_Sightings_Javascript by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the UFO Challenge
Dana, a data journalist, is creating a webpage depicting UFO sighting information as a table and creating filters. As part of the module, we created a filter by date. For the Challenge, we want to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, such as city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
In the Challenge, we accomplished this by adding four more list elements to the form in the html. This is how the filter looks now.

The table below shows that you can filter individually by each of the new list elements, while leaving the others blank.
<table>
  <tr>
   <th>By Date</th>
   <td><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84286467/131268821-10edd0c1-8e33-4669-b7fc-b55de67646ca.PNG" width=870 height=150></td>
