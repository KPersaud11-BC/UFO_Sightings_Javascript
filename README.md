# UFO_Sightings_Javascript by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the UFO Challenge
Dana, a data journalist, is creating a webpage depicting UFO sighting information as a table and creating filters. As part of the module, we created a filter by date. For the Challenge, we want to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, such as city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
In the Challenge, we accomplished this by adding four more list elements to the form in the html.
